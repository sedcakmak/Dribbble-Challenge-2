# Dribbble-Challenge-2
For this project, I got the inspiration from the CopyCat (Open Component) Challenge of Le-Wagon Coding Bootcamp. This time I created the repository from the browser and worked my way to the local.

As a second project, I wanted to choose a Dribbble page that contains multiple components, especially a form. I'll be reproducing this one: https://dribbble.com/shots/5393215-Vendimation-Login-Process

## The problems I couldn't solve (yet):
* I used grid system to separate page into two. At the beginning, I wanted to make it responsive, however I used so many position-absolute/relative on many components which I couldn't find a way to make responsive. Also, I still need some time to understand the relation between height-width and the grid system in order to be able to make it responsive.
* I started using Bootstrap 5, but I figured that it's going to be harder for me to implement several components. So I ended up not using Bootstrap. (Decided to do another project including only Bootstrap)
* I couldn't figure out what the middle dots are for (they don't belong to the slider since those are at the bottom of the slider, unless it has two sets of dots), so I omitted it.
* I tried several plugins for datepicker for Date of Birth, but I couldn't get them to work. I ended up putting a pseudo calendar icon using FontAwesome. I used regular CSS date, so when clicked on, you can choose the date from the calendar. (I didn't like the calendar, it's painful to choose a year:) Also, need to change mm/DD/yy format.)
* I didn't check the phone number with country codes. I just put the value as in the example.
* I may need some improvement with several HTML tags I used, especially in the form.(Regarding accessibility)
