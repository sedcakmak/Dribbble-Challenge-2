# Dribbble-Challenge-2
For this project, I got the inspiration from the CopyCat (Open Component) Challenge of Le-Wagon Coding Bootcamp. This time I created the repository from the browser and worked my way to the local. 

As a second project, I wanted to choose a Dribbble page that contains multiple components, especially a form. I reproduced this one: https://dribbble.com/shots/5393215-Vendimation-Login-Process

I used grid system to separate page into two.
